<h2>Mission</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: weathers; font-size: 22px;">#lostbalcony</span> is an online initiative warning of the loss of Georgia as the balcony of Europe. Georgia is often referred to as the "Balcony of Europe" because of its location on the edge of Europe, between Europe and Asia, it is historically closely linked to Europe.</p>

<p>The risk that in 2022, in the wake of a brutal war in Ukraine, Georgia will forget about its aspirations to join the European Union (EU) would be a historic mistake. Just like Ukraine and Moldova, Georgia is a part of Europe.</p>

<p><a href="https://persoenliches-georgien.de/tipps_ursprung.html" target="_blank"><img src="img/mission/schaedel_wein.png" width="160" align=right style="margin-left: 10px;" alt="" title="Homo georgicus - der erste europäische Winzer" /></a> The spread of Homo erectus from Africa to Europe is proven by current excavations in Georgia. These show how early humans can be found in Dmanisi - in southern Georgia - 2 million years ago.<br/>
Another form of European cultural heritage is viticulture, which has a long tradition in Georgia and dates back to 6,000 years BC. Chr. has left traces. Excavations show the cultivation of cultivated vines, which are still grown today.</p>

<p>While Georgia's relationship with Russia as a major neighbor in the Caucasus and Georgia as part of the Soviet Union shaped Georgia's history in the 19th and 20th centuries, this is no reason to exclude Georgia from the European family.</p>

<p>Georgia has always sought a close relationship with Europe, and the former flimsy geostrategic reasons should be superseded in the 21st century:</p>

He sought alliances with various European governments against Persia and the Ottoman Empire, but found no support.

<p>It was not until 1783 that King Erekle II signed a treaty with the Russian Tsarina Catherine II to protect him from the Persian horde and his troops, in which he undertook to recognize the Russian protectorate and to place his armed forces at the service of the Russian Empire.<br/>
At the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlacht_von_Krtsanisi" target="_blank">Battle of Krtsanisi</a>, however, Georgia had to face the Persians alone without Russian support, and the Georgians were defeated.</p>
<p><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demokratische_Republik_Georgien" target="_blank"><img src="img/mission/Flag_of_Georgia_(1918–1921).svg.png" width="140" align=left style="margin-top:10px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="" title="Flagge der DRG"/></a>However, because Russia was able to further expand its sphere of influence in the South Caucasus <a href="https://youtu.be/K34XQUzrrpI?t=851" target="_blank">in the 19th century</a>, an independent Georgian state was impossible.<br/>
It was not until the collapse of the Russian Empire in the February Revolution of 1917 that the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Georgia" target="_blank">Democratic Republic of Georgia</a> (DRG) was founded in 1918–1921.<br/>
On February 16, 1921, the DRG was occupied by the Red Army and incorporated into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" target="_blank">Soviet Union</a> as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic" target="_blank">Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> until the end of 1991.</p>
<p><img src="img/mission/Flag_of_Georgia.svg.png" width="140" align=right style="margin-top:10px; margin-left: 10px;" alt="" title="Flagge Georgiens"/>For Georgia, regaining independence was followed by a "dark" period with electoral fraud, widespread corruption, crime and stagnation of the economy at a very low level, but since the 2000s the desire to irreversibly gain independence from Russia has been solidified in Georgia's foreign policy make.<br/>
A geopolitical conflict which, with Russia's security interests on the one hand and the rapprochement Georgia is aiming for with the West, NATO, the USA and the EU, has shown through conflicts within Georgia as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War" target="_blank">Caucasus War in 2008</a> that Georgia has once again historically been left alone.</p>
<p>Even if Georgia's admission to the EU may not be on the agenda today, given the current political situation, the country must not be left to the arbitrariness of its big neighbor.<br/>
Together, this initiative wants to send a political signal against Georgia as <span style="font-family: weathers; font-size: 22px;">#lostbalcony</span> with pictures of balconies in Georgia. Georgia as a candidate for the EU is a political sign and it should not only be seen as an indescribably beautiful holiday destination on the edge of Europe, but as part of Europe with a future in the EU.</p>
